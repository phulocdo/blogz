Tampabay LaunchCode 2017
Unit#2 
Assignment: Blogz 
Objective: 
	In this assignment, we'll refactor and expand our codebase to make this a multi-user blog site. We'll add authentication, so that users have to log in to create posts. Additionally, users will have their own blogs page, and visitors will be able to view blogs by author, or they can view all blog posts on the site by all authors. And we'll still maintain the ability to view an individual blog entry by itself.

Here are the steps we'll take as we build our impressive blog app:

    Project Setup
    Overview of Improvements
        A Note About Use Cases
    Add User Class
    Add Login and Signup Pages
    Add Logout Function and Navigation
    Require Login
    Functionality Check
    Make a Home Page
    Create Dynamic User Pages
    Bonus Missions
        Add Pagination
        Add Hashin
